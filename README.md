📌 Problem Statement
With the rapid shift towards digital education, online assessments have become a cornerstone of modern learning. However, ensuring academic integrity in these remote environments remains a major challenge. Despite advanced proctoring platforms offering live monitoring and AI-based analytics, many fail to address:

Mobile phone-based cheating

Limited visual coverage using single webcams

Lack of integration between hardware and proctoring software

To overcome these limitations, we developed Eagle Eye—a cost-effective, hybrid proctoring system combining hardware and software innovations to enhance online exam security.

🚀 Project Highlights
📶 1. Novel Mobile Signal Detector Circuit
We designed a compact and cost-effective circuit that detects various mobile signals (calls, LTE, WiFi, data, and hotspot) within a 50 cm radius. This helps in real-time detection of unauthorized mobile usage during exams—something most existing systems overlook.

📸 2. “Eagle Eye” Auxiliary Camera Setup
To tackle the limitations of front-facing webcams, we introduced a top-view auxiliary camera that offers a bird’s-eye view of the student's workspace. This significantly improves visibility, reduces blind spots, and discourages malpractice.

🔄 3. First-of-its-Kind Hardware-Software Integration
Our system uniquely integrates the mobile signal detector and dual-camera setup into an interactive online proctoring workflow, making it an end-to-end monitoring solution that's scalable and budget-friendly.

💻 4. Feature-Rich Web Proctoring Platform
We developed an intuitive web interface with the following capabilities:

🧑‍🎓 Student Exam Portal

🧠 Face Recognition for Identity Verification

🚫 Anti-Tab Switching Detection

💬 Real-time Messaging between Students and Proctors

This fusion of hardware and software ensures a seamless, secure, and reliable exam-taking experience.

💡 Why Eagle Eye?
🔒 Revolutionizing Exam Security
Eagle Eye is a game-changer for online proctoring. It enables institutions to conduct cheat-proof online exams, saving time, manpower, and logistical effort while maintaining integrity.

📈 Elevating the Value of Online Certifications
By enhancing exam security, Eagle Eye helps boost the credibility of online degrees and certifications—fostering broader acceptance from both academia and industry.

💼 Scalable Business Opportunity
Our model fits well into a "Pay-and-Go" service structure, where institutions only pay per exam session. The hardware is reusable, offering a sustainable, budget-friendly solution for long-term use.

🔧 Installation & Setup (Coming Soon)
We’re in the process of open-sourcing our circuit diagrams, platform code, and setup instructions. Stay tuned for updates!
