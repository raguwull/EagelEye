##  Problem Statement

With the rapid shift towards digital education, online assessments have become a cornerstone of modern learning. However, ensuring academic integrity in these remote environments remains a major challenge. Despite advanced proctoring platforms offering live monitoring and AI-based analytics, many fail to address:

- **Mobile phone-based cheating**  
- **Limited visual coverage using single webcams**  
- **Lack of integration between hardware and proctoring software**  

To overcome these limitations, we developed **Eagle Eye**—a cost-effective, hybrid proctoring system combining hardware and software innovations to enhance online exam security.

## Project Highlights

###  1. Novel Mobile Signal Detector Circuit  
We designed a compact and cost-effective circuit that detects various mobile signals (calls, LTE, WiFi, data, and hotspot) within a **50 cm radius**. This helps in real-time detection of unauthorized mobile usage during exams—something most existing systems overlook.

###  2. “Eagle Eye” Auxiliary Camera Setup  
To tackle the limitations of front-facing webcams, we introduced a **top-view auxiliary camera** that offers a bird’s-eye view of the student's workspace. This significantly improves visibility, reduces blind spots, and discourages malpractice.

###  3. First-of-its-Kind Hardware-Software Integration  
Our system uniquely integrates the mobile signal detector and dual-camera setup into an **interactive online proctoring workflow**, making it an **end-to-end monitoring solution** that's scalable and budget-friendly.

###  4. Feature-Rich Web Proctoring Platform  
We developed an intuitive web interface with capabilities such as a Student Exam Portal, Face Recognition for Identity Verification, Anti-Tab Switching Detection, Real-time Messaging between Students and Proctors  

This fusion of hardware and software ensures a seamless, secure, and reliable exam-taking experience.

##  Why Eagle Eye?

###  Revolutionizing Exam Security  
Eagle Eye is a game-changer for online proctoring. It enables institutions to conduct **cheat-proof online exams**, saving time, manpower, and logistical effort while maintaining integrity.

###  Elevating the Value of Online Certifications  
By enhancing exam security, Eagle Eye helps **boost the credibility** of online degrees and certifications—fostering broader acceptance from both academia and industry.

###  Scalable Business Opportunity  
Our model fits well into a **"Pay-and-Go" service structure**, where institutions only pay per exam session. The hardware is **reusable**, offering a sustainable, budget-friendly solution for long-term use.
